                        Biomechanics
                        at the University of Waterloo. My interests lie in consumer product design, 3D printing,

                    During my second last co-op I was on the Mac Product Design Architecture team.

                    In my 4 month co-op at Voxel8 I designed fixtures and implemented processes to improve our
                    manufacturing capability.
                    I troubleshot printer issues, wrote python scripts to test devices and created pneumatic fixtures

                        Fallsafe is a project I worked on for Hack The North in 2016. The device is meant for elderly in retirement homes. The device is clipped to the user's belt and an IMU detects if a fall has occured.
                        After fall detection, an alert is sent via the PagerDuty API to alert the resident nurse that the patient may be in need. The project went on to win the PagerDuty sponsor prize.
